## Too Much Oil: How A Barrel Came To Be Worth Less Than Nothin

### Summary

- Such an eye-popping slide is the result of a quirk in the oil market, but it underscores the industry's disarray as the coronavirus pandemic decimates the world economy.
- Demand for oil is collapsing, and despite a deal by Saudi Arabia, Russia and other nations to cut production, the world is running out of places to put all the oil the industry keeps pumping out.
- Refiners are unwilling to turn oil into gasoline, diesel and other products because so few people are commuting or taking airplane flights, and international trade has slowed sharply. Oil is already being stored onn barges and in any nook and cranny companies can find. One of the better parts of the oil business these days is owning storage tankers.
