## Big Business, Shareholders And Society: What Companies Are For

### Summary

- Competition, not corporatism, is the answer to capitalism's problems.
- However well-meaning, this new form of collective capitalism will end up doing more harm than good.
- In the 1950s and 1960s America and Europe exprimented with managerial capitalism, in which giant firms worked with the government and unions and offered workers job security and perks. But after the stagnation of the 1970s shareholder value took hold, as firms sought to maximise the wealth of their owners and, in theory, thereby maximised efficiency.
- Collective capitalism suffers from two pitfalls: a lack of accountability and a lack of dynamism.
- A well-functioning polity does not exist today, but empowering the bosses of big businesses to act as an expedient substitute is not the answer. The Western world needs innovation, widely spread onwership and diverse firms that adapt fast to society's needs. That is the really enlightened kind of capitalism.
