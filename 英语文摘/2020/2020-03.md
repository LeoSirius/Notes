## This Is Why Singular 'They' Is Such A Controversial Subject

### Summary

- There are two reasons that singular they is on the upswing. One is that it's a convenient way to refer to an unknown person in a gender-neutral way. The other is that singular they is being used by individuals -- who might identify as transgender, non-binary, agener, intersex or even cisgender -- who don't feel like a gendered pronoun fits.
- Centuries ago, the pronoun you was used only in a plural sense: Individuals were referred to as thee or thou.
