## AIDS Crisis Shaped Anthony Fauci, Disease Expert At Front Lines Of Coronavirus Pandemic

### Summary

- Appointed director of NIAID in 1984, under President Reagan, the veteran scientist and HIV/AIDS researcher has spearheaded the nation's approach to preventing, diagnosing and treating epidemics for nearly four decades, advising six U.S. predidents.
- As a clincian, Fauci made significant breakthroughs in understanding how HIV destroys the body's immune system and helped develop strategies to bolster immune defense.
- At the White House, Fauci has not shied away from veering from Trump's message.
- Asked last week how he had managed to avoid being fired, Fauci told Science magazine that Trump listened, even if they at times disagreed.
- The grandson of Sicilian immigrants, Fauci was born in 1940 in Brooklyn and grew up in an apartment above his father's pharmacy, helping the family business by delivering prescriptions by bike.

## Big Tech: How To Make Sense Of The Latest Tech Surge

### Summary

- Even as regulators discuss new rules and activits fret about the right to privacy, the shares of the five biggest American tech firms have been on a jaw-dropping bull run over the past 12 months, rising by 52%.
- This surge in tech giants' share prices raises two worries.
- One is whether investors have stoked a speculative bubble.
- The other, opposite concern is that investors may be right. The big tech firms' supersized valuations suggest their profits will double or so in the next decade, causing far greater ecnomic tremors in rich countries and an alarming concentrarion of ecnomic and political power.
- Consumers say they care about privacy but act if they care much more about getting stuff, and preferably without having to pay for it in cash.

## Stop The Coronavirus Stigma Now

### Summary

- For years, it was common for viral diseases to be associated with the landscapes, places or regions where the first outbreaks occurred -- as in Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Zika virus, named after a forest in Uganda.
- But in 2015, the WHO introduced guidelines to stop this practice and thereby reduce stigma and negative impacts such as fear or anger directed towards those regions or their people.

## Disease In A World Without A Leader

### Summary

- Many people blame the coronavirus epidemic on globalization and say the only way to prevent more such outbreaks is to deglobalize the world: build walls, restrict travel, reduce trade. However, while short-term quarantine is essential to stop epidemics, long-term isolationism will lead to econimic collapse without offering any real protection against infectious disease. Just the opposite. The real antidote to epidemics is cooperation.
- Despite horrendous outbreaks such as AIDS and Ebola, epidemics kiil a far smaller proportion of human in the 21st century than in any previous time since the Stone Age. This is because the best defense humans have against pathogens is not isolation; it is information.
- What does this history teach us for the current coronavirus epidemic? First, it implies that you cannot protect yourself by permanently closing your borders. Second, history indicates that real protection comes from the sharing of reliable scientific information, and from global solidarity.
- If this epidemic results in greater disunity and mistrust among humans, it will be virus' greatest victory. When huamns squabble, viruses double. In contrast, if the epidemic results in closer global cooperation, it will be a victory not only against the coronavirus, but against all future pathogens.
